I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at [UC Berkeley’s Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) and [ICSI’s Big Data](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/groups/big-data) group, as well as an affiliate researcher in [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Machine Learning and Analytics](https://vis.lbl.gov) group. 

Most of my work focuses on *randomized linear algebra and numerical methods for large-scale modeling, optimization, and machine learning*. My supervisor is Michael Mahoney.

Before my current position, I did a postdoc in Paris at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) and [Jacques-Louis Lions Laboratory at Sorbonne](https://www.ljll.fr/en/the-laboratory/), under the supervision of Laura Grigori. I completed a joint PhD in *applied mathematics and civil engineering* through the [Simulation in Engineering and Entrepreneurship Development](https://www.cimne.com/emjd-seed/) program, a collaboration between Centrale Nantes  and Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), where I was supervised by Anthony Nouy and Nuria Parés. Prior to that, I earned a joint master's degree in [Computational Mechanics](https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/erasmus-mundus-computational-mechanics) from Swansea University and UPC. My undergraduate studies were in Taiwan at National Chiao Tung University (now National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), where I double-majored in *electrophysics* and *applied mathematics*.
