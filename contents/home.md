I am a senior postdoctoral researcher in [Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) and [Big Data group at ICSI](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/groups/big-data), as well as an affiliate researcher in [Machine Learning and Analytics group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.](https://vis.lbl.gov)

Most of my work focuses on *randomized linear algebra* and *numerical methods for large-scale modeling, optimization, and machine learning*. My supervisor is Michael Mahoney.

Previously, I did a postdoc in Paris at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) and [Jacques-Louis Lions Laboratory](https://www.ljll.fr/en/the-laboratory/) at Sorbonne, under the supervision of Laura Grigori. I earned a joint PhD degree in *applied mathematics* and *civil engineering* as part of the [Simulation in Engineering and Entrepreneurship Development](https://www.cimne.com/emjd-seed/) program, a collaboration between Centrale Nantes  and Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), where I was supervised by Anthony Nouy and Nuria Par√©s. Prior to that, I earned a joint master's degree in [Computational Mechanics](https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/erasmus-mundus-computational-mechanics) from Swansea University and UPC. My undergraduate studies were in Taiwan at National Chiao Tung University (now National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), where I double-majored in *electrophysics* and *applied mathematics*.
